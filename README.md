This is a fork of the osmdroid project from: https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid

# osmdroid

osmdroid is a (almost) full/free replacement for Android's MapView (v1
API) class. It also includes a modular tile provider system with
support for numerous online and offline tile sources and overlay
support with built-in overlays for plotting icons, tracking location,
and drawing shapes.

This fork breaks API compatibility from OSMDroid.

# building

GNU Make is your friend.

`make jar` should build you a jar under the target directory.
